# BrandFour Tech Test

This is my attempt at the BrandFour tech test. As specified, I have built the
front page for a site, using the provided flat design for guidance. All
elements of the page are responsive. As such, the user experience should be
consistent across a wide variety of devices.

# My approach

The site has been built using a combination of HTML, CSS (SASS) ad Jquery. My
approach was to break the site down into it's main constituent elements and work
to complete each block in isolation before moving on to next area.
